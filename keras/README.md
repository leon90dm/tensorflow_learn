# [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)

> - User friendly.
Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.
> - Modular and composable.
Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.
> - Easy to extend.
Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create new layers, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.

**Keras makes TensorFlow easier to use without sacrificing flexibility and performance.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
```
